    let age = 100
    let age2 = age
    age = 200
    console.log(age, age2)
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    players[3] = 'tee-hee'
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team)
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    // ...and another
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    console.log(team5)
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    captain.age = 99
    console.log(person.age)
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 100})
    // syntax is a blank object, the base object for contents, then stuff you want in there
    console.log(captain2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person}
    console.log(captain3)
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const person2 = {
      social: {
        facebook: "none"
      }
    }

    const person3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person2))
    person3.social.facebook = 'some'
    console.log(person2.social.facebook)
    console.log(person3.social.facebook)
